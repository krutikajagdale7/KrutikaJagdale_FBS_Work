//SYNTAX:size_t strxfrm(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
//ransforms a string into a form that can be compared using strcmp(),
//equivalent to how strcoll() would compare them.
//strxfrm = is scan first and then it will acompare
//Useful when you need to sort many strings using locale rules efficiently â€” you preprocess them once with strxfrm() and then just call strcmp().
